* $mdSidenav appears to cause double click on mobile devices - [issue is with jQuery and Angular Material](https://github.com/angular/material/issues/1842)

	**Workaround is to long-press options in the sidenav under angular material $mdSidenav component**

	*$mdSidenav fixed by including ngTouch module into app. However, toggle sub-menus still not fixed.*
